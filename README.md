## FAQ

### Why?

This simply restores functionality that already existed on previous OS versions.

### Can't I just use Cesium instead?

Yes.

### Can I run at the same time as Cesium?

Yes, starting with Cesium version 3.3.0.

### How long does it last?

Until the next ram clear, but it persists through Garbage Collects.

### Which one should I install?

Just use AsmHook2.8xp if you are able to transfer it.  If you are using TI-Connect CE for Chrome OS then you may have to use AsmHook2_unprot.8xp instead.

### How do I install?

Assembly programs were removed from recent OS versions, which are also the only versions for which this program is actually useful.  This means that you have to be able to run assembly programs in order to run this program that allows you to be able to run assembly programs.  Therefore, you'll need some sort of jailbreak-like program first, in order to bootstrap running this program.

### What does ERR:INVALID mean?

You have recent OS that disables assembly programs, see the previous answer.
